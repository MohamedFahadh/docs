# JDBC
Connect to any ANSI-compliant database using this connector using a JDBC driver.

## Supported databases
All ANSI-compliant databases with a JDBC driver

## How to connect to JDBC on Workato
To create a connection to a JDBC source, you **must** use an [On-premise agent](/on-prem.md). The JDBC connector uses JDBC authentication through an On-premise agent to establish a secure connection with your JDBC driver. Learn how to configure an [on-premise agent profile](/on-prem/agents/profile.md#jdbc-profile) to connect to a JDBC-compliant database.

The JDBC connector only supports ANSI-compliant databases like **Snowflake** and **SAP HANA**. The database should support binding variables to be able to use some actions such as **INSERT**.

## Working with the JDBC connector

### Table and view
The JDBC connector works with all tables and views available to the credentials used to establish the connection. These are available in pick lists in each trigger/action, or you can provide the exact name.

Case sensitivity of the name of a table/view depends on your database implementation.

### Single row vs batch of rows
JDBC connector can read or write to your database either as a single row or in batches. When using batch triggers/actions, you have to provide the batch size you wish to work with. The batch size can be any number between 1 and 100, with 100 being the maximum batch size.

*Batch trigger inputs*

Besides the difference in input fields, there is also a difference between the outputs of these 2 types of operations. A trigger that processes rows one at a time will have an output datatree that allows you to map data from that single row.

![Single row output](~@img/jdbc/single_row_trigger_output.png)

However, a trigger that processes rows in batches will output them as an array of rows. The <kbd>Rows</kbd> datapill indicates that the output is a list containing data for each row in that batch.

As a result, the output of batch triggers/actions needs to be handled differently. The output of the trigger can be used in actions with batch operations (like Salesforce **Create objects in bulk action**) that requires mapping the <kbd>Rows</kbd> datapill into the source list. Learn how to work with lists in [List management](/features/list-management.md#using-datapills-in-an-action-with-a-list-input-action-handles-list-processing-implicitly).

### WHERE condition
This input field is used to filter and identify rows to perform an action on. It is used in multiple triggers and actions in the following ways:
- filter rows to be picked up in triggers
- filter rows in **Select rows** action
- filter rows to be deleted in **Delete rows** action

This clause will be used as a `WHERE` statement in each request. This should follow basic SQL syntax.

#### Simple statements

String values must be enclosed in single quotes (`''`) and columns used must exist in the table/view.

A simple `WHERE` condition to filter rows based on values in a single column looks like this.

```sql
currency = 'USD'
```

If used in a **Select rows** action, this `WHERE` condition will return all rows that has the value 'USD' in the `currency` column. Just remember to wrap datapills with single quotes in your inputs.

![Using datapills in WHERE condition](~@img/jdbc/use_datapill_in_where.png)
*Using datapills in `WHERE` condition*

Column names with spaces must be enclosed in double quotes (`""`) or square brackets (`[]`). For example, **currency code** must to enclosed in brackets to be used as an identifier.

```sql
[currency code] = 'USD'
```

![WHERE condition with enclosed identifier](~@img/jdbc/where-condition-with-enclosed-identifier.png)
*`WHERE` condition with enclosed identifier*

#### Complex statements

Your `WHERE` condition can also contain subqueries. The example below selects inactive employees from the `compensation` table (presumably to ensure they're not accidentally compensated).

```sql
id in (select compensation_id from users where active = 0)
```

When used in a **Select rows** action, this will select all rows in the `compensation` table related to users who are no longer active (`active = 0`).
