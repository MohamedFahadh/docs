        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Project</td>
      <td>The project available in the connection to be billed for the query.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Query</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Batch size</td>
      <td>The number of rows in each job. Jobs may be processed faster when batch sizes are smaller.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Schedule settings</td>
      <td>Set how often you want this query to run. The minimum period is 1 hour to give previous triggers sufficient time to batch and complete.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Automatic schema introspection</td>
      <td>Workato automatically tries to introspect the output of your query. In cases where the query takes too long or if datapills are used, toggle this to false and define the output fields of your query manually.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Output fields</td>
      <td>This input field appears when "Automatic schema introspection" is false. Use this to manually define the output fields of your query. The names given to the output should be identical to the column names expected. <br> <a href='/connectors/bigquery.html#defining-your-output-fields'>Find out how to define your output fields quickly and easily.</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Unique key</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Location</td>
      <td>The geographical location of where the job should be run. This field isn't required in most cases.</td>
