# BigQuery - New row triggers

## New row trigger
This trigger picks up rows that are inserted in the selected table. Each row is processed as a separate job. It checks for new rows once every poll interval.

        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Project</td>
      <td>The project available in the connection to be billed for the query.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Dataset</td>
      <td>The dataset which the action or trigger will pull the possible tables from.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Table</td>

      As such, the values in the selected column should not be repeated in your table. Typically, this column is the primary key of the table (e.g. `ID`) and must be of type integer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Output columns</td>
      <td>After selecting your table, you'll also be able to select which columns you want returned. Selecting only what you need for your recipe increases job throughput and overall efficiency of the recipe.</td>

## New rows batch trigger
This trigger picks up rows that are inserted in the selected table or view. These rows are processed as a batch of rows for each job. This batch size can be configured in the trigger input. It checks for new rows once every poll interval.
