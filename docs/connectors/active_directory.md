# Active Directory
Active Directory is a directory service developed by Microsoft to manage access to resources in a network. The service runs on a Windows Server.

## How to connect to Active Directory on Workato
The Active Directory connector authenticates with LDAP protocol, which is only available via the on-premise agent.
