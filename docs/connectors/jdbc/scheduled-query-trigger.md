# JDBC - Scheduled query trigger

## New/updated batch of rows via scheduled custom SQL
This trigger picks up rows that are inserted/updated in the selected table or view. Each row is processed as a separate job. It checks for new/updated rows once every poll interval.

## Input field details

### SQL
Provide the SQL to be executed to select rows. The SQL here will be used to generate the output datatree. To do this, the SQL will be executed once when you provide it. You can map datapills here to execute dynamically changing SQL statements. Remember to wrap datapills in quotes (`''`).

Avoid using limit clauses like `TOP` in your SQL. This is because the limit to the number of rows returned in the query is based on the value defined in the [**Batch size** input field](#batch-size). Adding your own limit clause will cause the action to fail.

### Schedule
Select the type of schedule you want for your integration use case. This input field is a pick list with the following available choices:
- hourly
- daily
- monthly

### Timezone
Select the timezone for the scheduler to be set in. This is a required field.

### Hour
Configure the hour of the day you wish to execute the scheduled SQL query. This is required only if you selected **daily** or **monthly** as the [Schedule](#schedule).

### Minute
Configure the minute in the hour you wish to execute the scheduled SQL query. This is always required.

### Day of month
Provide a value between **1** to **31** for the day of the month. In shorter months, the values may be rounded down to the last day of the month. For example: if you use the value **31** and the month ends before the 31st, the trigger will run the SQL query on the last day of the month (e.g. 28th Feb, 31st Mar, 30th Apr, and so on)

Needed only if you selected **monthly** as the [Schedule](#schedule). This is an optional field that defaults to first day of the month if left empty.

### Days of week
Choose the days of the week you wish to execute the scheduled SQL query. This is required only if you selected **hourly** and **daily** as the [Schedule](#schedule). If you selected **hourly**, the trigger will execute the SQL hourly on days that are selected here.

### Batch size
Batch size of rows to return in each job. This can be any number between **1** and the maximum batch size. Maximum batch size is **100** and default is **100**.

In any given poll, if there are fewer rows than the configured batch size, this trigger will deliver all rows as a smaller batch.
