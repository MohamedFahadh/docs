        Select the folder to upload the file to. This can be done either by selecting a folder from the pick list, or toggling the input field to text mode and providing the folder path.<br>
        This should be relative to the base path you define in the connection profile. Learn about <a href="/connectors/on-prem-files.html#relative-path">relative path</a>.</td>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>File name</td>
      <td>
        Name of the file to be uploaded. This should only be the file name without any path.

      <td>Overwrite existing file?</td>
      <td>
        If <b>Yes</b>, contents in an existing file with the <b>same name and extension</b> will be replaced.<br>
        If <b>No</b>, a new file will be created with an incremental number appended to the end of the file name.

Subsequent uploads will create <b>report_2.csv</b> and <b>report_3.csv</b>.
