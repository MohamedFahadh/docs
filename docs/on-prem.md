# On-prem Connectivity
Enterprises have on-prem applications and databases that are deployed within their corporate data centers. These apps are protected via firewalls, and therefore are typically not easily accessible to cloud services like Workato.

> On-prem access is enabled only for certain users. Reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.

## Overview
The following is a conceptual model of Workato's on-prem agent and how it interacts with databases and applications behind the firewall.

On-prem agents can also be installed into logical groups, called [On-prem groups](/on-prem/groups.md), to achieve **High Availability** and **Load Balancing** capabilities.

## How it works
Workato on-prem connectivity has 2 core components:
- Tunneling
- Database, file system, and application access.

The on-prem agent runs within the user's server, typically behind a firewall, and establishes a TLS websocket tunnel to connect out to Workato.

Since the on-prem agent is within the same network as systems behind the firewall, it can safely access them and act as the agent to communicate securely out to Workato.

## Supported operating systems
The on-prem agent runs on the following systems:

- Linux (64-bit)
- Windows 7, 10 (64-bit)
- Mac OS X

Minimum hardware requirements are:

- 8GB of RAM
- 250 MB of disk space
- 800 Mhz 64-bit CPU (Intel/AMD).

Learn how to setup for each OS [here](/on-prem/agents/setup.md).
