# Run On-prem Agent
An on-prem agent requires an active connection between the agent running within your network and Workato's [On-prem group dashboard](https://workato.com/on_prem_groups/).

You may occasionally need to temporarily disable this connection. For example, restarting or [upgrading](/on-prem/agents/upgrade.md) the on-prem agent.

## Disable on-prem agent
To do so, simply select **Disable agent**.

## Re-establish connection with on-prem agent
To reconnect your on-prem agent to Workato, you have to do the following steps. Please follow the instructions according to your network's operating system.

### Running on Linux 64-bit and Mac OS X
If your on-prem agent is installed in a Linux or Mac OS, run the on-prem agent using the following bash script:

```bash
sh <INSTALL_HOME>/bin/run.sh
```

If you are accessing the server through SSH and want to let the agent run in the background independent of your shell session, you can add the nohup command (`&`) at the end. You can also include a `> file_name` command to ensure that the outputs are logged.

```bash
sh <INSTALL_HOME>/bin/run.sh > opa_output.txt &
```

Level of details of the OPA logs depend on your configuration. [Learn more](/on-prem/agents/logging.md).

## Running on Windows 64-bit
For on-prem agents installed in Windows, run the agent as a Windows console application or as a [Windows Service](#using-windows-service).

Run the on-prem agent in console mode by launching `Workato` &rarr; `Run Agent (console)` in the Start Menu.

Alternatively, you can use the `Run Agent (console)` shortcut to ensure the agent is successfully connecting to Workato using the provided certificate.

### Using Windows Service
The installer automatically registers an agent (`WorkatoAgent`) as a Windows service . However, the agent does not start automatically. Navigate to the service configuration (**Control Panel → System and Security → Administrative Tools → Services → WorkatoAgent**) to configure service auto-start.

### Browsing log files
When the on-prem agent is running as a Windows service, log files can be found at: `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\LogFiles\Workato`. There's also a shortcut to the Workato log directory in the `Workato` group found in the Start Menu. 

Level of details of the OPA logs depend on your configuration. [Learn more](/on-prem/agents/logging.md).

### Changing save location for log files 
To change the save location for log files, launch `Workato` &rarr; `Service Wrapper Configuration` in the Start Menu. Navigate to the `Logging` tab where you can modify `Log path` and then navigate to the `Startup` tab where you can modify the `Arguements`.  

## On-prem agent is reconnected
To finish re-establishing the connection, go to the On-prem group dashboard and connect to your on-prem agent.
