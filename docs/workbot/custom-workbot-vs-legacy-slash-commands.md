# Custom Workbot vs Legacy slash commands
Workato supports both [slash commands that are part of a custom Workbot](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) (i.e. a custom Slack app) and legacy slash commands (i.e. [Custom Integrations slash commands](https://slack.com/apps/A0F82E8CA-slash-commands)).

We strongly recommend using custom Workbots to configure your slash command, as custom integrations is a legacy feature that will eventually be deprecated (no news as to when just yet). Legacy slash commands also does not support some of the functionalities that custom Workbots have.

Custom Workbot slash commands requires [creating a new Slack app](/workbot/workbot-custom-bots.md), and connecting it to Workato via a custom OAuth profile, while legacy slash commands does not. You can add legacy slash commands to a Slack workspace directly from the Slack app directory.

Here is a detailed comparison table between the custom Workbot slash commands and the legacy slash commands.

## Notes for custom Workbot slash commands

1. Make sure that Workbot is always in the channel to run commands. Do this by inviting it to the channel.
2. When you invite Workbot into the channel, **anyone** in that channel can interact with Workbot via commands.
