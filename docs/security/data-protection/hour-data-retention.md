# Data retention

Enterprises want to be empowered to control the destiny of their data. The data retention setting supporting as low as one hour does just that. You have more control over your data making it easy to have robust data protection operations. With data protection standards, such as GDPR, and the sheer mass of data that companies collect and accumulate, the protection and control of information have become increasingly important.
