# People Task (Workflow)
The people task feature enables the addition of human approval steps within the recipe. Complex tasks requiring human judgement can be directed to an approver, then subsequently redirected based on whether the task was approved or rejected.

# Using People Task as an admin

## People Task setup
People Task feature is enabled only for certain users. Reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.

For Workato accounts with People Task feature enabled, team owners are able to view the People Task option in their 'Tools' page. Click on 'All Tools' and then on 'People Task'.

### Customize People Task subdomain

If accessing People Task for the first time, the People Task account needs to be configured. Provide a unique subdomain and customize the site for People Task approvers.

The following portrays the configuration for Workato Demo Inc. in the **People Task** setup screen. This configuration can be changed after the initial setup.

# People Task example scenario

## Recipe
The following recipe triggers on new hires in BambooHR and sends a People Task approval task from John in HR to Jill the payroll manager. An email notification should be sent to Jill to inform her about the new task pending her approval.

*Recipe that uses People Task to approve and add sensitive data about new hires*

If the task was approved, the recipe proceeds to stage the new hire's details for uploading into ADP. If the task does not get approved, however, the recipe would stop with an error to flag this particular job for troubleshooting - as all new hires should get recorded in ADP.

## People Task step configuration
In the People Task step, there are several fields to take note of:

### Approving tasks
As the approver, review the document sent and provide any data requested by filling in the fields. Required fields would be marked as such. All tasks will provide the approver with the option of adding an **Approver note**.

Subsequently, approve or reject the task. The recipe will resume the job to carry out further recipe steps. Once a task has been approved or rejected, it can be found within the **Completed** tab.
